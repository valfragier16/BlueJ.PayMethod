# BlueJ.PayMethod

Create a method that takes in the following parameters `String name`, `double hourlyRate`, `double hoursWorked`, and `deductionRate`. You will used this figures to figure out the gross pay, net pay, and deduction that is seen on your pay stub.

Additionally, create a test case to check if your Method works against an input of a string.

** If stuck try incorporating `System.out.println()` to check what is happening when your script is ran.
